# EHR-Blockchain
Designing an Electronic Health Record (EHR) using blockchain technology involves several 
considerations, such as data privacy, data integrity, data availability, and data interoperability. In this 
design, we will use Ganache and MetaMask to set up a local blockchain network and user interface. We 
will use Solidity to create smart contracts for patient and doctor registration, and to store and retrieve 
health records on the blockchain.
